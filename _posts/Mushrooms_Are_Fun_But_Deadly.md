Picture this: it has been raining all week and you finally get the perfect weekend to go mushroom foraging. Your mushrooming skills aren't great, but you really want some fresh mushrooms to make a decadent mushroom risotto. The trouble is, will you pick the right mushrooms?

Let's try and train a model to pick the poisonous mushrooms out for us. We don't trust our mushroom judgement. We can work with this dataset from Kaggle [[1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)], describing 23 mushroom species from the Lepiota and Agaricus families. Our dataset is labelled, meaning we know if the recorded mushrooms are poisonous or edible. Here's a sneak peak of the data:
