## 📚 Goals

I’m a quantitative environmental biologist who has completed multiple research projects where I demonstrate my ability to wrangle, manage, analyse and visualise complex data. I am now looking to move into a data driven career and improve these skills in the corporate world. 

## 👩🏻‍💻 Skills

My education and experience have equipped me with a variety of programming, modern statistical, and software tools that i am eager to put into practice to gain invaluable insights from big data and drive company growth. To achieve this, I am currently a Data Scientist in training at [Digital Futures](https://digitalfutures.com/), who are taking an inclusive approach to bringing diverse talent into tech.

## 🌲 Knowledge

Outside of data and analytics my expertise lies in sustainability, ecology, evolution, plant and animal resources. I'm mostly interested in marine biodiversity and it's influence on climate dynamics.

## 🎹 Personal Interests

I enjoy playing the piano, hiking and scuba diving. I also like taking photos that are accidentally not terrible and going to live music events.

## 📂 Current pet project

My passion for music has made me an avid reader of [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/)'s music reviews. I want to investigate how their choice in reviewed music has changed over the years, and if there are any musical spheres (topics) that have interesting dynamics over time. For this, I am web-scraping their end of year lists since the year 2000 and will report summary analytics of my findings. I will also do some NLP and topic modelling on the scraped reviews.
