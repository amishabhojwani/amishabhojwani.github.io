## 📚 Goals

I’m a data professional and quantitative researcher growing and contributing my skills with Thoughtworks. I help leverage big data analysis and visualisation to drive high level decision-making.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Skills

My current expertise surrounds data visualization and effective dashboarding (**Tableau**), including gathering requirements and using agile methodology to continuously improve deliverables. I am also skilled in descriptive and predictive statistical methods, having a keen interest in the intersection between dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. To implement this knowledge I count on programming languages like **Python** or **R**, and couple them with big data using **SQL**.

## 🎹 Personal Interests

I am interested in sustainability and enjoy playing the piano, hiking and scuba diving. I also like photography and going to live music events.
