## 📚 Goals

I’m a quantitative environmental biologist who has completed multiple research projects where I demonstrate my ability to wrangle, manage, analyse and visualise complex data. I am now looking to move into a data driven career and improve these skills in a business environment. 

## 👩🏻‍💻 Skills

My education and experience have equipped me with a variety of programming, modern statistical, and software tools that i am eager to put into practice to gain invaluable insights from big data. To achieve this, I am currently a Data Scientist in training at [Digital Futures](https://digitalfutures.com/), who are taking an inclusive approach to bringing diverse talent into tech.

## 🌲 Knowledge

Outside of data and analytics my expertise lies in sustainability, ecology, evolution, plant and animal resources. I'm mostly interested in marine biodiversity and it's influence on climate dynamics.

## 💻 Programming Languages

- **OOP** in R and Python. 
- **Command line** and scripting in Bash and PowerShell. 
- **Database management and querying** with PostgreSQL and SQL.
- **Markup and typesetting** with Markdown and LaTeX.
- Learning the basics of C. 

## 🌐 Human Languages

- Spoken and written: English, Spanish, Catalan and French. 
- Spoken: Hindi and Sindhi.

## 🎹 Personal Interests

I enjoy playing the piano, hiking and scuba diving. I also like taking photos that are accidentally not terrible and going to live music gigs.
