## 📚 Goals

I’m a quantitative researcher who has completed multiple projects where I demonstrate my ability to wrangle, manage, analyse and visualise complex data. I'm now starting off my career in data where I will apply the statistical and computational methods I’ve learned to provide businesses with valuable insights and agile pipelines.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Skills

My education and experience have equipped me with a variety of programmatic, statistical, and software-based tools that i am eager to put into practice to gain decision-making power from big data to drive corporate growth. To achieve this, I am currently a Data Scientist in training at [Digital Futures](https://digitalfutures.com/), who are taking an inclusive approach to bringing diverse talent into tech.

## 🎹 Personal Interests

I am interested in sustainability and enjoy playing the piano, hiking and scuba diving. I also like photography and going to live music events.

## 📂 Current pet project

My passion for music has made me an avid reader of [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/)'s music reviews. I want to investigate how their choice in reviewed music has changed over the years, and if there are any musical spheres (topics) that have interesting dynamics over time. For this, I am web-scraping their end of year lists since the year 2000 and will report summary analytics of my findings.
