## 📚 Goals

I’m a data professional and quantitative researcher who forms part of the Business Insights team at Vueling Airlines. I help leverage big data analysis and visualisation to drive high level decision-making. With this external consulting opportunity through [VISEO IBERIA](https://www.viseo.com/en/ela/news/viseo-iberia-main-offers-and-services) I hope to gain more knowledge on cloud systems and big data management.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Skills

My education and experience have equipped me with a variety of programmatic, statistical, and software-based tools. The most in demand ones are Python, SQL and Tableau. I enjoy statistical programming used for predictive modelling and I want to gain more skills in model deployment and maintenance.

## 🎹 Personal Interests

I am interested in sustainability and enjoy playing the piano, hiking and scuba diving. I also like photography and going to live music events.

## 📂 Current pet project

My passion for music has made me an avid reader of [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/)'s music reviews. I want to investigate how their choice in reviewed music has changed over the years, and if there are any musical spheres (topics) that have interesting dynamics over time. For this, I am web-scraping their end of year lists since the year 2000 and will report summary analytics of my findings.
