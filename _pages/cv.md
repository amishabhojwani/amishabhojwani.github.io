## Education
* MSc in Computational Biology and Statistics, Imperial College London, 2020-2021
* BSc in Environmental Biology, Autonomous University of Barcelona, 2015-2019

## Data Science Projects
* Whale and dolphin image classification, March 2022, [GitHub](https://github.com/amishabhojwani/Whale_And_Dolphin_Image_Classification), [Blogpost](https://amishabhojwani.github.io/posts/2022/05-images_in_python)
  * To automate processes in ecological research, I built a deep learning model that identifies whale and dolphin families with over 70% accuracy from images of dorsal fins.
* Poisonous mushroom detection, February 2022, [GitHub](https://github.com/amishabhojwani/Poisonous_Mushroom_Prediction), [Blogpost](https://amishabhojwani.github.io/posts/2022/03-mushrooms)
  * If you’re foraging without a mushroom guide, I built class predictive models to indicate the edibility of a mushroom with full
  certainty, based on a minimum number of biological traits.
* Model selection criteria, January 2021, [GitHub](https://github.com/amishabhojwani/Functional_Response_Modelling)
  * Given the discourse in academic literature, I analyse the boundaries of reliability for AIC and BIC as metrics for model selection between mechanistic and polynomial models.
